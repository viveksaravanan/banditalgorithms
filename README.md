## Experimentts

python run.py all # runs all experiments
python run.py test # runs on a subset of all experiments

python run.py etc # runs Explore-then-Commit algorithms
python run.py ucb # runs Upper Confidence Bound algorithms
python run.py ts # runs Thompson Sampling algorithms 
python run.py linear # runs Linear Thompson Sampling and Linear Upper Confidence Bound algorithms

Results are plots which are saved in '/Results'
